# Boids
#------------
# Description: what we want here is a clas for Boids. Instead of just having a method, we want to construct a class that consists of an object 'the boid' (or seveal? All the boids?) for which we describe methods and more.

# So something like:

my_boids = Boids(nr_of_boids)

for something in something:
    my_boids.update(time?)

This should be the body of the code.
